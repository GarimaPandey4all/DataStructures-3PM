Data Structures:

Two Types of Data Structures:

1. Linear Data Structures

	i. Arrays
	ii. Linked List
	iii. Stack
	iv. Queue

2. Non-Linear Data Structures

	i. Tree
	ii. Graph
	iii. Dictionaries
	iv. Heaps
	
int array[]={2,3,4,5,7};
int array[][3]= {};

Searching:

1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

Linear Search:

2,4,5,7,8,8,99,0

search = 99

Binary Search:

2,4,5,7,8,8,99,0

search= 99

First=0, Last=7

Middle= (First+Last)/2;

Middle = (0+7)/2= 3

Fisrt=Middle+1= 4

Last=7

Middle= (4+7)/2= 5

First = Middle + 1= 5+1 = 6

Middle = 13/2 = 6
