Trie:

A trie is called a digital tree or prefix tree is a kind of 
search tree an ordered tree data structure.

It is used to store dynamic set or associative array where the
keys are usually string.

It is a tree that stores strings. Maximum number of children of
a node is equal to size of alphabet. 

Trie supports search, insert, delete operations in O(L) 
where L is the length of key.

Hashing:

In hashing we can convert key to a small value and the value 
is used to index data. Hashing supports search, insert and 
delete operations in O(L) time on average.

Advantage of Trie:

1. It is faster than hashing because of the ways it is
implemented. we do not need to compute any hash function.
No collision handling is required.

2. We can easily print all words in alphabetical order in
which is not easily possible with hashing.

3. We can efficiently do prefix search with trie.

Disadvantages of  Trie:

1. A lot of memory required for storing the strings.
because of each node have too many node pointers.

Huffman Coding:

Huffman coding algorithm was invented by david huffman in 1952.
