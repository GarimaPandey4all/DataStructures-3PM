A queue is an example of ticket queue outside a cinema hall.

Queue follows the first-in-first-out(FIFO) rule-the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first too.

enqueue(): is the operation for adding an element into queue.

dequeue(): is the operation for removing an element from queue.

How Queue Works:

1. Two pointers called Front and Rear are used to keep track of the first and last elements in the queue.

2. When initiliazing the queue, we set the value of Front and Rear to -1.

3. On enqueuing an element, we increase the value of REAR index and place the new element in the position pointed to by REAR.

4. On dequeing an element, we return the value pointed to by Front and increase the Front index.

5. Before enqueing, we check if the queue is already full.

6. Before dequeing, we check if the queue is already empty.

7. When enqueing the first element we set the value of front to 0.

8. When dequeing the last element, we reset the values of front and rear to -1.
